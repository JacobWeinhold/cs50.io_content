1. What’s stdint.h?
stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library providing a set of typedefs that
specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum
allowable values for each type.

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

These types are used to prevent errors by limiting the data the variable can hold.
In that way the type is preventing the variable from having data it shouldn't have.

Image formats have different "bits per pixel" definitions so we can use the right data type for each one then. 

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

A BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD and LONG are 4 bytes and WORD is 16 2 byte.

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?

ASCII: "BM", Hex: 0x424D, Dezimal: 16973. This value is stored in "bfType" in the BITMAPFILEHEADER struct.

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

bfSize is the size of the BITMAP file in total and biSize is the size of the image(pixels) itself, without the headers.
BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER together have a size 54 of bytes. So bfSize=biSize + 54 bytes.  

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is stored upside down. 

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

As the fopen functions opens a file, it will return NULL if the file is not found or can not be opened for any reason,
such as restrictions in user rights.

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

We want to read one element at a time, there we pass 1 as the argument for the parameter telling the number of elements to read at a time.

10. What value does copy.c:65 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    
3 will be assigned to padding. As "(4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;" will be (4-(3*3)%4)%4=3.
sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) is 3, as the struct holds the size of the type BYTE 3 times. 


11. What does fseek do?

The fseek function is used to set the position of the cursor in an openeded file.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?

One of three possible arguments for the whence parameter in fseek.
SEEK_CUR passed as the whence arguments tells fseek to start at the current cursor 
position and then add the number of bytes passed as an argument for offset. The sum 
of that is the new cursor position then.
